# Cancer-Predictor
Developed a machine learning-based Cancer Predictor that employs various classification algorithms to determine
the presence of cancer in individuals by analyzing a set of relevant features by using Python programing language.
• Preprocessing techniques were utilized to remove redundant properties from the data, optimizing the model’s
performance.
• Implementing multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to achieve accurate predictions.
